# Disabling Classic Bluetooth
BR/EDR is enabled automatically so the recepients of the advertisement packets think that the device supports Classic bluetooth as well.
When tried to connect from Android device, it tried to do pairing using Classic Bluetooth.
Asked in the bluez mailgroup how to enable LE only and the answer is below.

## Information from the Bluez mailing group
You could try setting ControllerMode=le in the [General] section of
/etc/bluetooth/main.conf and restart bluetoothd. Another option is to
disable BR/EDR manually with btmgmt ("btmgmt bredr off").
In the latter case, you need to power off the adapter before you can disable BR/EDR, i.e. "btmgmt power
off".
