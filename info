# Disabling Classic Bluetooth

## Information from the Bluez mailing group
You could try setting ControllerMode=le in the [General] section of
/etc/bluetooth/main.conf and restart bluetoothd. Another option is to
disable BR/EDR manually with btmgmt ("btmgmt bredr off").
In the latter case, you need to power off the adapter before you can disable BR/EDR, i.e. "btmgmt power
off".
